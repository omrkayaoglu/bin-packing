# Bin Packaging problem with genetic algorithm

## Definition and Purpose of the study
The 2D regular rectangular packing problem is a bin packing problem that attempts to line up a certain size and number of rectangles within a rectangular area, with minimal spacing.
The purpose of this problem is to place the rectangles in the most efficient way and make the best use of space.
This problem is important in many areas such as production, storage and transportation.
For example, it has a search for solutions for problems such as the most effective storage of products produced in a factory and the loading of transportation vehicles.

This problem is widespread and has many different applications.
For example, an e-commerce site has a search for solutions for problems such as shipping the products at the least cost, storing the parts produced in a factory in the most effective way.
Many methods are used to solve this problem. For example, methods such as real-time algorithms, genetic algorithms, artificial neural networks are used.
This problem is also used in many different fields such as mathematics, computer science, engineering and industrial engineering.

## Cutting and Bin Packaging problems
Cutting and packaging problems are optimization problems frequently encountered in the manufacturing or trade sectors.
These problems arise when a particular piece of material needs to be cut or packed in a particular way.
The purpose of these problems is to ensure that the material or packaging material is used in the best possible way.

Packaging problems are generally defined as:
• Objects of certain size and shape should be packed.
• The use of packaging material should be done in the best possible way.
• The gaps between the packed objects should be as minimal as possible.
These problems can be solved using mathematical modeling and optimization methods. For example, genetic algorithms, simulation-based methods or linear programming methods can be used for cutting problems. For packaging problems, genetic algorithms, artificial neural networks or heuristic methods can be used.
